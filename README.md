# monolith

ever wanted to smash a bunch of host files together with a shitty bash script? ...me neither


## Description

monolith is a simple tool for fetching and condensing arbitrarily large amounts of host file sources


## Features

* Yes


## Usage

* Switch to the home directory
(not necessarily required, we just have to put the lists file somewhere)
```
cd ~
```

* Create your own lists file (one source per line) in the same directory as monolith
or download the example lists file
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/monolith/main/lists
```

* Download and run monolith
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saint-lascivious/monolith/main/monolith
chmod +x monolith
./monolith
```
The output will be saved to the current directory as
```
monolith_YYYYMMDDHHSS.tar.gz
```


## To-Do
* Accept lists file via argument

* More robust stripping logic

* Help function

* Suggestions?
